# Overview
HandFlow is a project that combines the power of machine learning and computer vision to assist users in assembling components onto a breadboard. 
By guiding the user's hand to specific points, it simplifies the process, making it more efficient and accessible, especially for beginners or those with limited experience in electronics.
# Features
* Hand Tracking: Utilizes advanced hand tracking algorithms to accurately guide the user's hand.
* Component Outline Display: Shows the outline of the component on the screen for precise placement.
* User-friendly Interface: There is no need to use the mouse or keyboard, you can switch to the next or previous component with hand gestures
* The user is able to train an AI model to recognize individual components!
